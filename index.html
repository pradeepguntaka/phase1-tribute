            <h3>Bears Behavior and ecology</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Feeding</strong> - Most bears are opportunistic omnivores and consume more plant
                    than
                    animal
                    matter, and appears to have evolved from an ancestor which was a low-protein macronutrient
                    omnivore
                </li>
                <li><strong>Communication</strong> - Bears produce a number of vocal and non-vocal sounds.
                    Tongue-clicking, grunting or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such as between
                    mothers
                    and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, snorting or blowing air is made when
                    an
                    individual is stressed.</li>
                <li><strong>Reproduction and development</strong> - The mating system of bears has variously
                    been
                    described as a form of polygyny, promiscuity and serial monogamy.</li>
                <li><strong>Hibernation</strong> - Bears of northern regions, including the American black bear
                    and
                    the
                    grizzly bear, hibernate in the winter.[107][108] During hibernation, the bear's metabolism
                    slows
                    down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value
                    of
                    55 to
                    just 9 beats per minute.</li>
                <li><strong>Mortality</strong> - Bears do not have many predators. The most important are
                    humans,
                    and as
                    they started cultivating crops, they increasingly came in conflict with the bears that
                    raided
                    them.
                    Since the invention of firearms, people have been able to kill bears with greater ease</li>
